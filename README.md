# Failure-of-Two-Party-System
In this project we aim to identify clusters of US adults based on input features relating to political ideology. We are motivated to investigate whether there are prominent groups of people who share the same views or background beyond the simple binary of left and right. We want to see if this clustering might reveal that the American people really fit a multi-party system, rather than the 2-party system that has dominated American politics so far.

Through clustering, we can determine the optimal k, the number of clusters that exist in the data. If k > 2 is well supported, this might show that more than 2 opposite, divisive political groups exist in the US, and that we should focus on fostering a system that can better represent all k groups.

If strong clusters are formed from those input features (political views) we can further explore the nature of those clusters. Will those clusters be strengthened if we include input features like demographic information and world views that are not directly related to politics? If so, those groups will not just represent political ideologies; they'll represent populations and views in general.
